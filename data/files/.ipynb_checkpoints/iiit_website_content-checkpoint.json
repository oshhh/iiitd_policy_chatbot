Therefore it does not tolerate any form of academic dishonesty. Almost all violations of academic honesty in course submissions (homework assignments, project reports) are instances of plagiarism. Details about plagiarism, how to avoid it and its consequences are described in a document available <strong><a href=\"../../sites/default/files/docs/education/2017/Plagiarism Policy - Updated.pdf\">here</a></strong>. A brief summary of this document is given below.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\"><strong>Plagiarism is the offence of taking undue credit for someone else\u2019s work.</strong></span></h4>\n<p>When you submit an assignment, the instructor basically wants to evaluate/ grade you on what you did. And unless you explicitly indicate that some part is not done by you, it is implicitly assumed that the entire assignment was done by you. Academic dishonesty is displayed when some part(s) of your assignment are someone else\u2019s writing/ idea/ art (for example a friend, a solution manual, a website), but you claim it as your own by not explicitly making it clear that these parts are someone else's.</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you have to use some existing work, you cannot copy - you can only borrow (when you borrow, you do not claim ownership of the borrowed item). Therefore, it is your responsibility to explicitly indicate which parts are borrowed. You are allowed to borrow definitions, formulae, figures, one sentence, etc. by (1) attributing it to the original source AND (2) making it absolutely clear that the copied part is not your own (you need to do both).</p>\n<p>Most of the times, students are led to academic dishonesty simply because their solution ended up unnecessarily containing a significant amount of non-original work. An easy way to avoid this is to ensure that the sources are not in front of you \u2013 if it was a book, do not have it open in front of you, if it was a website, then do not have it on screen. Do not memorise what you have read - unlike practices in school, we do not encourage memorisation by heart. And this is what is needed from you in all your homeworks \u2013 explain whatever you want in your own words based on your own understanding. If you are discussing a homework assignment with others (make sure the instructor has allowed it in that particular course), you can avoid dishonesty by (1) if you have seen your friend\u2019s homework, ensure that it is not open in front of you when you do your own (2) mentioning your collaborators in your submission.</p>\n<p>Nick Morris describes the four major types of plagiarism as follows below. The following excerpt is taken from his webpage, with his kind permission.</p>\n<ol><li>\u2018Text\u2019 - copying text from a book, paper, document etc.</li>\n<li>\u2018Diagrams &amp; Program\u2019 - copying a diagram or a program</li>\n<li>\u2018Idea\u2019 - passing off another person\u2019s idea as your own</li>\n<li>\u2018Auto\u2019 - copying from yourself!</li>\n</ol><p><strong>Text Plagiarism:</strong> This is the most easy to understand, and the most common form of plagiarism. Basically it is the copying of text from some source (a paper, text book, fellow student, internet) into your own work, and then passing it off as your own. It should be noted that adding a reference (i.e. stating from where you copied the text) is no 'protection' and doesn't mean you can copy (unless it has been explicitly allowed). If you find yourself reaching for the copy and paste keys on the computer then there is a good chance it will be plagiarism.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagram &amp; Code Plagiarism:</strong> This is where you copy a diagram, figure or a chunk of code from somewhere else and pass it off as your own (this can also be viewed as 'idea' plagiarism as some one has thought long and hard about creating the figure or code). Note that, straightforward modifications to the original figure or code is still considered plagiarism.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea Plagiarism:</strong> This is the worst form of plagiarism as you would be attempting to pass off the hard work, and intellectual property, of a fellow person as your own. You can write about the ideas and thoughts of others, but YOU MUST STATE FROM WHERE YOU GOT THE IDEA. Basically, this is one of the reasons why we reference sources of information, you are stating who had the original idea, and how they came by it. Effectively by referencing you are acknowledging the hard work of the others.</p>\n<p><strong>Auto-Plagiarism:</strong> This form of plagiarism is the one most people have difficulty understanding. After all, how can you plagiarise yourself? You 'own' the work and the intellectual property! Well, basically auto-plagiarism would occur if you handed in the same piece of work for two different assignments and got two lots of marks for it. Or put another way, it is like making one burger in McDonald's and selling it twice.<br/>\nRead the <a href=\"../../sites/default/files/docs/education/2017/Plagiarism Policy - Updated.pdf\">academic dishonesty policy</a> for complete information. Some courses may have its own policy, so read and understand policies for individual courses or ask the course instructor for clarifications in case of doubt.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions about Plagiarism</strong></span></h4>\n<ol><li><strong>Is it okay if I am not submitting verbatim copy, but (1) modify few phrases here and there (2) rewrite some of the sentences (3) modify the solution sentence by sentence (4) copy only a small part (5) for programs, change variable names and function names?</strong><br/>\n\tAll of the above constitute plagiarism even though you are not really submitting a verbatim copy of someone else\u2019s work. It is clear in all of the above cases that none of the submitted solutions are your own yet by submitting them, you claim them to be your solution - this is obviously plagiarism.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I copied (i.e. verbatim) just the introduction, and also gave reference to the paper from where I copied.</strong><br/>\n\tThis is not allowed \u2013 you can borrow verbatim only one/ two sentences, that too by quoting. Anything more, you have to say in your own words.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>By \"copy\u201d, do you mean \u201ccopy-and-paste\u201d operation?</strong><br/>\n\tYou got to be kidding! Here \u201ccopy\u201d refers to any kind of similar items and copying means anything that creates something which is similar to the original. Copying could be done manually, or using tools, or computer based \u2026 if you are in doubt, first clarify with the instructor. Also, remember that physical similarity is NOT the only basis behind a copy, similarity in idea, style \u2026 all of these mean a copy.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Is it okay if I submit (1) a modified form of existing solution (2) existing solution which is paraphrased/ quoted properly (3) my own writing based on someone else\u2019s idea (4) someone else\u2019s program with my modifications AND I give proper reference to the source in all the cases.</strong>\u00a0<br/>\n\tYou may not be charged with plagiarism if you make it clear what is your work. But note that, the instructor may give you zero, if your solution ends up containing only borrowed material.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I mugged up an entire solution from obtained via solution manual, the internet, some friend, some other book and then wrote it down. Is this prohibited?</strong><br/>\n\tYes, this is plagiarism. Mugging up the solution is same as writing it keeping having the source open in front of you. It goes against the spirit of you understanding the solution and be able to express it in your own words - basically, you are copying the solution idea.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Can I copy from lecture notes? From text-books? From papers part of the curriculum of a \u00a0paper-reading course?</strong><br/>\n\tNo. Unless explicitly allowed, you can not copy verbatim from textbook or lecture notes or other instruction material. Anyway, it is unlikely in IIIT-Delhi that you will be asked questions in any homework/report whose answers appear verbatim in text. However, you can use the ideas given in such instructional material without any restriction. Some courses may require you to give precise answers (e.g., definitions) as given in the book or lecture notes; please clarify with the instructor if you are allowed to copy in such cases.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Do I have to cite everytime I use \u201cQuicksort\u201d in my homework?</strong><br/>\n\tNo. You are allowed to freely use/ refer concepts/ ideas covered in the instructional material (the textbook, lecture notes, slides, your notes) - in fact, you are encouraged to do so. But you still may not copy any text/ example/ figure verbatim (unless explicitly allowed to do so).<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Are these instances of plagiarism?</strong><br/><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong> I used a theorem given in the textbook in my homework solution. This is NOT plagiarism because you can freely use ideas/ results in instruction material without restriction.<br/><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong> I used a theorem which I found on a website in my proof, which I did not cite. This is plagiarism if you didn\u2019t cite the source. Without citation, and since the theorem is not in the book, it will appear as if you should be given credit for the theorem.<br/><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong> I used a theorem which I found on a website in my proof, and I also cited the website. If the course allowed referring to the internet, then this is not plagiarism.<br/><em><strong>Scenario:</strong></em> The question in the homework is similar a solved question given in the book. So I copied (verbatim) most of its solution from the book. You are not allowed to verbatim copy from the textbook. This IS plagiarism since you are claiming credit for the solution which was in fact given by the authors of the book.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Is it plagiarism to take external help to do homework, e.g., can I discuss with my classmates, can I search on the internet? Can I do XYZ?</strong><br/>\n\tThere could be course specific policies prohibiting any of these, but as such external help taken to increase understanding of the homework/ paper/ project does not constitute plagiarism. However, borrowing solution idea from the internet, or from a classmate, is plagiarism unless explicitly allowed.<br/>\n\tGenerally, in most courses in IIIT-Delhi, discussion with fellow students in the same course is allowed (unless explicitly disallowed), but copying from someone else\u2019s assignment is never allowed. Similarly, you may be allowed to look on the internet, or consult a reference book, to understand relevant topics required to do the homework/ report/ project, but using text/ code/ idea from these sources is not allowed. Since specific instructors might prohibit specific actions as per course policy - if you have doubt always ask the instructor.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I discussed my homework with my senior, or with some other person not in my class, or on some online forum.</strong><br/>\n\tThis is usually not allowed in IIIT-Delhi and may be counted as plagiarism. Other than the instructor and the TAs, usually you can only discuss with your classmates. Also, if you discuss with your classmates, you have to specify their names as collaborators.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I was accused of plagiarism in my programming assignment/ project. But I had changed all variable names, all function names and cleaned up the solution. Is this still plagiarism? What if I started by copying a sample program, and then added \u201call\u201d the required functionality to create my final project?</strong><br/>\n\tThe first case is clearly plagiarism. The program you submitted is essentially someone else\u2019s work. Claiming it to be yours is plagiarism. In the second case, if you added \u201call\u201d the functionality required by the homework, then it may not be a case of plagiarism - however, to be on the safe side, you should not attempt this without explicit consent of your instructor.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>In our schools/ colleges we are often encouraged to write answers as close as possible to what is given in the book. Why is it not allowed here?</strong><br/>\n\tIn most of our assignments, you are unlikely to find questions of the type \u201cdescribe xxx\u201d which can be found in the textbook. But if you do, as described above, it is better for you to write in your own words to avoid the risk of getting zero.<br/>\n\tThis is quite different from the school system where you were encouraged to report verbatim what was taught in the class or given in the book. In the school system, homework are meant to be preparation for board-level exams, in which exact answers are preferred to maintain consistency and to evaluate knowledge. This is very different from the scenario at IIIT-Delhi - here homeworks are often evaluated for understanding.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I did not intend to cheat. I had no idea &lt;something&gt; is not cheating. I have a doubt if &lt;something&gt; is cheating.</strong><br/>\n\tYou are responsible for writing your own solution. It is your responsibility to ensure that your action is not breaking any rule, no matter what your actual intentions are. If in doubt, always clarify with the respective instructor/ official. If there is lack of time or scope in getting in touch with them, take the safest path.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I cheated \u00a0in two different homework. \u00a0The two homework had been evaluated together - does this count as one cheating or as repeated cheating?</strong><br/>\n\tIt is a repeated cheating since when you submitted the second homework you knew that you had already cheated once.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Even though I have copied someone else\u2019s solution, I actually understand the solution.</strong><br/>\n\tIt does not matter - you are still guilty of plagiarism - the solution you are claiming credit for was prepared by someone other than you. In fact, in such case you should have written the solution in your own words. If you submitted a copied version, the instructor has no way to know if you actually understood the solution.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Do the same rules apply to an instructor of a course for the material he/ she uses in the course?</strong><br/>\n\tNo. The instructor of a course is assumed and expected to use existing material. By rule, teaching does not require inventing new material, and almost always involves existing material - in terms of ideas/ content/ explanation. A teacher is never assumed, explicitly or implicitly, to use anything of his own. On the other hand, when a teacher \"submits\" a proposal/ paper, writes a book, gives a talk, the exact same rules of homework submission also applies to him/ her. For example, when a faculty member makes a presentation in a conference - there it is assumed that the material/ slides are his/ her own - in these presentations, presenters will generally cite the source, if they take some slide from somewhere.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I copied without citing and when caught, I accepted my \u201cmistake\u201d. What will happen?</strong><br/>\n\tOnce found guilty of plagiarism, institute policies will be applicable even if you accept it later.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Is copying from Wikipedia allowed?</strong><br/>\n\tNot without citation, and that also only when referring to internet/Wikipedia is allowed in your course. Please refer to the Wikipedia copyright policy.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I am facing a new situation. How do I know if &lt;something&gt; would be plagiarism?</strong><br/>\n\tThe rule of thumb is: if there is anything in the submission which you borrowed from somewhere else, then you should make it explicit what is borrowed and from where.<br/>\n\tHowever, for specific cases, you should always clarify with the instructor.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Do I have to cite all sources of an idea/ text/ proof?</strong><br/>\n\tNo - you only need to cite one source for each part of borrowed material.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Why is the punishment so harsh for plagiarism compared to other simple mistakes? Why isn\u2019t it sufficient to award a zero in the corresponding HW?</strong><br/>\n\tPlagiarism is a serious offence, much more than a simple mistake. Plagiarism - taking false credit - is an issue of ethics and is actually a serious offence in academics - similar to copyright violation in civil laws. That\u2019s why the punishment goes beyond giving zero in the respective HW. On the other hand, a student my quote/ cite as per rule all throughout and be not guilty of plagiarism. But he may still get zero since his whole answer or just contains citation/ paraphrasing and he showed no understanding which was required. or maybe because he borrowed the main idea of the proof (even though be cited).<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>If I am only copying part of the solution, I am making an honest effort to solve it and I also understand the solution. Since I am learning in the end, why is this not allowed? Why is the institute trying to constrain our sources of studying?</strong><br/>\n\tThe objective of these rules is not to ensure whether students are learning or by how much - learning is evaluated by the instructor using separate means.<br/>\n\tPlagiarism - taking false credit - is an issue of ethics and is actually a serious offence in academics - similar to copyright violation in civil laws. Academic plagiarism is a big problem worldwide, and is rising in India due to lack of proper awareness. We want to maintain the integrity of the academic environment of the institute, and would like to see our students follow the same standard of academic integrity as followed by us and by others in the rest of the world. Just to increase awareness, some recent cases of academic plagiarism are listed in the following two links.

The Instructor responsible for conducting the lectures, tutorials, and labs, holding the tests and examinations, evaluating the performance of the students, and awarding grades at the end of the semester/ summer term. A system of continuous evaluation is employed, in which, during a course, various instruments like tests, exams, assignments, projects etc. are given to assess the learning of students. All evaluations are the responsibility of the instructor of the course. At the end of the semester, based on the overall performance in the course, a letter grade is awarded to each student by the instructor. Each letter grade carries certain points which are used in the computation of the semester/ overall performance.</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\">Grading Scheme</span></strong></h3>\n<ol><li>One of the letter grades given in the following table shall be awarded to a student reflecting his/her overall performance in a course.

This grade must be converted to a regular letter grade (A+ to F) within one month of the end of the current term (i.e., the moderation date). For courses other than project / independent study, I is meant primarily for medical reasons. All unconverted I grades get automatically converted to F after the grade conversion deadline, which is one month after the moderation date.</li>\n<li>In certain courses, such as self-growth and community work, Online\u00a0Courses, Thesis, Scholarly Paper only S or X grade is awarded.</li>\n<li>The F and X grades are \u201cfail\u201d grades and the student shall be required to repeat the course. If the course is a compulsory course, the same course shall be repeated in another semester/summer when the course is offered. In the case of an elective/optional course, the student can replace the course by another elective course.</li>\n<li>For B.Tech. students at most one compulsory course, after getting an F twice in the course, a student may be allowed to replace it by an elective course of the respective discipline with the permission from DOAA.</li>\n<li>An F and X grade obtained in any course shall be reflected in the grade sheet. However when the course is replaced or repeated, the new grade will be used for computation of the CGPA. \u2018F\u2019 grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in the calculation of SGPA.</li>\n</ol><h4>Change of Grade Already Awarded</h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">As mentioned in Ordinances, a letter grade once awarded shall not be changed unless the request is made by the Instructor-in-Charge of the course and is approved by the Chairman, Senate. Any such request for change of grade must, however, be made within four weeks of the start of the next semester with all relevant records and justification.</p>\n<h4>Grade Improvement</h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">For B.Tech. students, for some important core courses, refresher modules may be offered during vacations for students\u2019 benefit. Students who got a low grade earlier in the course, may be allowed to enroll in these and based on their performance in the refresher module, their grade may be improved by at most one letter grade. Decision regarding whether these modules are to be offered during vacation and whether they may be used for grade enhancement will be taken every year. As with a grade change, this grade improvement will be approved and authorized by Chairman, Senate.</p>\n<h4>Repeat (Improvement) of a particular course</h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">Repeat of a course completed with pass grade may be allowed, but only the best Grade in that course be counted for CGPA computation. Also all attempts in that course will be recorded in the respective semester transcripts. It is also made clear that a repeat course will not be permitted to be dropped after mid-semester examination.</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\">Performance Indicators</span></strong></h3>\n<p><strong>The semester performance is indicated by a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) which is a weighted sum of all the points earned in the courses done in a semester.

The decision whether the degree is to be pursued for skill and knowledge up-gradation, or also for building research skills should rest with the student. The Institute also believes that a student should be given an option of pursuing M.Tech. without assistantship so he/she can focus full time on the program, and possibly finish the program sooner, as compared to a student who is on Assistantship and so has to do part-time work in lieu of the assistantship.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The Institute feels that to address the needs of the industry, which today requires more specialized manpower as each field is getting more complex, it is desirable to provide specializations within CSE and ECE in the M.Tech. program. For this, the Institute permits a student to do a \"M.Tech.\" or \"M.Tech. with specialization\". The following are the available specializations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>M.Tech. (Computer Science and Engineering)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>M.Tech. in CSE with Specialization in <a href=\"https://iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/ai\">Artificial Intelligence</a></li>\n<li>M.Tech. in CSE with specialization in <a href=\"https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/data-engg\">Data Engineering</a></li>\n<li>M.Tech. in CSE with specialization in <a href=\"https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/info-sec\">Information Security</a></li>\n<li>M.Tech. in CSE with specialization in <a href=\"https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/mtech/mobile-comp\">Mobile Computing</a></li>\n<li>M.Tech. in CSE (without specialization)<br/><br/></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>M.Tech.

The decision whether the degree is to be pursued for skill and knowledge up-gradation, or also for building research skills should rest with the student. The Institute also believes that a student should be given an option of pursuing M.Tech without assistantship so he/she can focus full time on the program, and possibly finish the program sooner, as compared to a student who is on Assistantship and so has to do part-time work in lieu of the assistantship.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The Institute feels that to address the needs of the industry, which today requires more specialized manpower as each field is getting more complex, it is desirable to provide specializations within CSE and ECE in the M.Tech program. For this, the Institute permits a student to do a \"M.Tech\" or \"M.Tech with specialization\". The following are the available specializations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/mtech/cse\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">M.Tech (Computer Science and Engineering)</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/mtech/ai\">M.Tech in CSE with Specialization in Artificial Intelligence </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/mtech/data-engg\">M.Tech in CSE with specialization in Data Engineering</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/mtech/info-sec\">M.Tech in CSE with specialization in Information Security</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/mtech/mobile-comp\">M.Tech in CSE with specialization in Mobile Computing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\">M.Tech in CSE (without specialization)</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/mtech/ece\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">M.Tech (Electronics and Communications Engineering)</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/mtech/vlsi\">M.Tech in ECE with specialization in VLSI &amp; Embedded Systems</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/mtech/csp\">M.Tech in ECE with specialization in Communication and Signal Processing</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Note :</strong> The candidates need to indicate her/his preferences for all specialization in a program while filling the online application.

Over time, we aim to build EcoLab into a hub that generates the evidence and builds capacity around the use of digital tools and networks in environmental activism. </p>\n<h4>About workshop</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This workshop is to introduce EcoLab and explore, as a community, the potential of youth-led online activism in taking a proactive role in enabling stronger environmental policies and social impact. <br/><br/>\nIn this invite-only workshop, we aim to bring  key stakeholders from the fields of environment, social media, activism, young people and policy makers in Bangalore for a collaborative and open engagement. We also hope that participants\u2019 inputs, narratives and experiences will help highlight significant concerns and help us identify crucial issue areas in Bangalore which need to be studied in-depth. Besides, this it aims to contribute to the collaborative ecosystem of environmental activism in the expanding metropolis.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Date :</strong> 13<sup>th</sup> July 2019</p>\n<h4>Who is it for?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Policy-makers and journalists</li>\n<li>Technology and digital media developers</li>\n<li>Social media influencers: On Youtube, Twitter, Tik Tok, Blogs and hyper-local news media</li>\n<li>Community group mobilisers: Especially from grassroots environmental networks</li>\n<li>Students: Members of students societies, Enactus groups, Volunteer networks</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Outcomes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding lived experiences of environmental activism in Bangalore</li>\n<li>Identifying ley issues that need attention, ones in which youth can contribute meaningfully</li>\n<li>Identifying the role of social media, WhatsApp and other digital networks in enhancing participation and youth engagement in environmental issues</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Workshop Agenda</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>9:00 \u2013 9:15 AM: </strong>Welcome speech + Opening Comments - Prof. Dr. R Venkata Rao, Vice Chancellor, NLSIU\n<li><strong>9:15 - 9:45 AM: </strong>Introduction to EcoLab - Presentations (By Dr. Aasim &amp; Dr. Sarayu)\n<li><strong>09:45-10:00 AM: </strong> Coffee Break\n<li><strong>10:00-11:00 AM: </strong>Keynote + Introductory comments<br/>\nKeynote address \u2013 Abhayraj Naik<br/>\nIntroductory comments by stakeholders \u2013 individual speakers TBD</li></li></li></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>", "Amarjeet Singh": "<div id=\"content-wrap\">\n<!-- line added by ankit -->\n<h1 class=\"page-title\">Amarjeet Singh</h1> <div class=\"region region-help\">\n<div class=\"block block-system\" id=\"block-system-main\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"Amarjeet Singh\" property=\"dc:title\"></span><span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" property=\"sioc:num_replies\"></span>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-display-picture field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://www.iiitd.ac.in/sites/default/files/public/faculty/amarjeet_0.jpg\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"180\"/></div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-role field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Assistant Professor (CSE, ECE)</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-education field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">PhD (2009), Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, USA</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p>Dr. Amarjeet Singh received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2009.

At present, there are four hostels, three for the boys having 508, 394 &amp; 280 beds and another for the girls with 380+10(Dormitory) seats. Also, there are 22 married hostel accommodations available for married PhD students. Each room in all the hostels is provided with furniture needed by a student - bed, table, chair, bookshelf, cupboard, etc. The rooms are provided night time air conditioning in summers, and heating in winters. High-speed Internet connectivity is also available in hostels. At present, the hostels have options of single, double and triple occupancy air-conditioned rooms. The rooms are provided night time air conditioning in peak summers, and heating in peak winters (<a alt=\"Schedule\" href=\"../sites/default/files/docs/life/ac-schedule-for-hostels.pdf\">Schedule for AC</a>). There are 4 guest rooms available at the hostels for guests visiting the institute. All hostel students are completely free to move around the campus at all times, and some of the study areas are open 24x7 for the benefit of students. In order to provide 24X7 medical cover to our Faculty, Staff and students both who are hostellers and day scholars, the Institute has setup an Infirmary at Ground Floor in the Girl's Hostel.\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There is a common mess for the boys and girls which function during the working semester and breaks. Air conditioning is provided in the mess during lunch time. During the winter and summer vacations, a special mess is run for students who are required to stay in the hostels for pursuing academic, sports or cultural activities. It is compulsory for all hostel residents to avail the mess facilities. Day-scholars can eat in the mess by paying the meal cost as notified. In addition to the common mess, there are two cafeterias, one located in the academic building and the other in the common mess building which caters to the needs of the students and faculty. The Dining and Recreation Centre contains the students' mess, facilities for extracurricular activities, such as a music room, art room, table tennis, pool tables and a gymnasium which are spread over three floors. Cafeteria, ATM facility, stationery shop and open space for students are available at the ground floor. Life at IIIT-Delhi is more than just classes and homework\u2019s. Several student clubs in the institute enable students to enhance talents in areas beyond academics.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Each hostel also has a Hostel Committee which is an advisory body comprising the Dean (Student Affairs) and the elected student representatives as its members. The Hostel Committee also coordinates with the Mess Committee for the running of the mess. Students can relax in the evenings or on holidays, or spend their leisure time in the Common Room which is equipped with a TV, newspapers and magazines. Sports and other recreational facilities are available on the upper floors of the dining building.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">An external security agency has been contracted for providing security at the hostels. The services of the security personnel are monitored by the GM-Facility Management Services (FMS). Besides, a Mess Committee is also formed out of representatives from hostel committees and day scholars. The Mess Committee monitors the quality, taste and hygiene of the food served in the mess. They also interface with the mess vendor to provide him with the feedback of students and effect changes in the weekly menu. Periodical review and inspection of the quality of food items also form part of their duties.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact</strong>: Hostel related communications shall be done via only <strong><a href=\"mailto:admin-hostel@iiitd.ac.in\">admin-hostel@iiitd.ac.in</a></strong>.

Part time students may register for any number of units lesser than the normal full-time load.</p>\n<h3 class=\"rtejustify\"><strong><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\">Course Work Requirements</span></strong></h3>\n<ol><li class=\"rtejustify\">The requirement of the course work for a PhD student is aimed at providing the basic academic preparation to carry out the research, and have sufficient breadth in the area. The minimum course requirement for a PhD student is normally 32 units for students whose highest degree is a BTech (or equivalent), and 16 for those who have an MTech (or equivalent). The PG committee may ask the students with insufficient background to do additional courses (in addition to 32/16 units). For detailed course of requirement refer <a href=\"https://iiitd.ac.in/sites/default/files/docs/education/2015-July-PG-Regulations.pdf\">PG regulations</a></li>\n<li class=\"rtejustify\">In special cases, for students with advance standing by virtue of their academic preparedness and/or by virtue of their professional work experience, some of the course requirements may be waived. All such waivers shall be decided upon by the PG Committee and reported to the Senate.</li>\n<li class=\"rtejustify\">The PhD students are expected to finish their course requirements as per the timelines mentioned in <a href=\"https://iiitd.ac.in/sites/default/files/docs/education/2015-July-PG-Regulations.pdf\">PG Regulations.</a></li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify; padding-bottom:10px;\">Transfer of Credits for Courses done Outside: Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute outside IIIT-Delhi. Based on their performance/quantum of work done and the content of the course, the PG committee may consider them equivalent to some course credits, and waive credit requirements for similar courses/projects within IIIT-Delhi. Institutions with which IIIT-Delhi has arrangements/MOU/student exchange programs, transfer of credits may also be permitted. Any such waivers/transfer is permitted only if the courses being considered have not been counted for any other degree/diploma requirement.</li>\n<li class=\"rtejustify\">A PhD student may be permitted to replace up to two courses done by him/her and in which he/she has obtained passing, but not good, grade. The replacement will be permitted as and when the request is made by the concerned student. In this case, the earlier course will be listed in the transcript as having been taken on \u201cAudit\u201d. He / She may also be permitted to do extra courses to improve the CGPA. All such permissions shall be granted by the PG committee upon requests from the students.</li>\n</ol><h3 class=\"rtejustify\"><strong><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\">Teaching Requirements</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">One of the potential career options for the research students is academics. The PhD program at IIIT-Delhi aims to develop suitable teaching skills among the research students through teaching requirements. Towards this, it requires all students on financial assistantship plan of the Institute are required to take part in the teaching activities. All PhD students must be TA for at least two semesters to satisfy the teaching requirements for a PhD degree. Students on research assistantship will also be required to complete this requirement, though they may be assigned lighter load each semester. The teaching requirement may be waived for part-time and/or sponsored candidates.</p>\n<h3 class=\"rtejustify\"><strong><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\">Thesis Requirements</span></strong></h3>\n<ol><li class=\"rtejustify\">All PhD students irrespective of their entry category are expected to successfully complete a minimum of 56 units by thesis. In truly exceptional cases where the PhD candidate is ready with a thesis before he/she has accumulated these credits, the PG committee can consider waiving off some of these units. For the purpose of grading in the thesis units registered, the progress in the thesis work shall be assessed by the thesis supervisor(s). For each semester, one S (if the performance is satisfactory) or one X (if the performance is not satisfactory) grade shall be awarded by the thesis supervisor(s). The thesis grades shall be submitted by the thesis supervisor(s) at the end of the semester.</li>\n<li class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Thesis supervisor and external co-supervisor: </strong>The thesis work shall be done under the guidance of the PhD supervisor, who shall be a faculty member of the Institute. There may be multiple supervisors. Normally, a student is expected to decide the supervisor(s) by the start of the second semester but can defer it till the end of second semester .This will be done by informing the PG Committee through a form, which shall be signed by the supervisor(s). A student can change the supervisor later \u2013 for this a formal request will have to be submitted to PG Committee and has to be signed by the old as well as the new supervisor. A student may also have external co-supervisors for the thesis. Such external co-supervisor shall be approved by the PG Committee upon a request by the student, duly approved and forwarded by the supervisor(s). The request must be accompanied by the CV/Bio or sufficient information about the proposed external co-supervisor which will allow the PGC to evaluate the suitability. Normally, the external co-supervisor should be finalized before the comprehensive and the PGC should be informed by the adviser and the student about the same.</li>\n<li class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Thesis evaluation and defense:</strong> All PhD theses will be evaluated by a panel of thesis examiners who are experts in that area, and the candidate will have to defend the thesis in front of this panel. The panel will consist of supervisor(s) of the student, and a minimum of three non-supervisor examiners, at most one of which can be from within the Institute. A thesis defense date will be fixed, after taking inputs from all examiners on the panel. The defense shall be open to all. At the end of the defense, the panel will deliberate and make an overall recommendation.</li>\n</ol><!--<p><strong>* Note :</strong> Eligibility criteria and other details for HCD will be updated shortly.</p>--></div></div></div> </div>\n<footer>\n</footer>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- /.block -->\n</div>\n<!-- /.region -->\n<!-- /.region -->\n<!-- line added by ankit -->\n</div>", "About SSH Department": "<div id=\"content-wrap\">\n<!-- line added by ankit -->\n<h1 class=\"page-title\">About SSH Department</h1> <div class=\"region region-help\">\n<div class=\"block block-system\" id=\"block-system-main\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"About SSH Department\" property=\"dc:title\"></span><span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" property=\"sioc:num_replies\"></span>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><div class=\"linkbox\" style=\"min-width:150px;\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/departments/ssh\">Home</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/departments/ssh/about\" style=\"color:#000;\">About</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/departments/ssh/faculty\">Faculty</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/departments/ssh/programs\">Programs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/academics/departments/ssh/admissions\">Admissions</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div> </div>\n<footer>\n</footer>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- /.block -->\n</div>\n<!-- /.region -->\n<!-- /.region -->\n<!-- line added by ankit -->\n</div>", "IT Infrastructure": "<div id=\"content-wrap\">\n<!-- line added by ankit -->\n<h1 class=\"page-title\">IT Infrastructure</h1> <div class=\"region region-help\">\n<div class=\"block block-system\" id=\"block-system-main\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"IT Infrastructure\" property=\"dc:title\"></span><span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" property=\"sioc:num_replies\"></span>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><style type=\"text/css\">\n<!--/*--><![CDATA[/* ><!--*/\n*{text-align:justify} #sidelinks { display:inline; float:right; width:auto; border-radius:6px; background:#3fada8; border:2px solid #3fada8; margin:5px 20px; } #sidelinks a,#sidelinks a:link,#sidelinks a:visited,#sidelinks a:hover,#sidelinks a:active { color#fff!important; text-decoration:none; } #sidelinks p{margin:0;display:inline-block;} #sidelinks a { display:inline-block; color:#fff; background:#3fada8; padding:10px 10px; margin:0; border-radius:4px; transition:0.3s; } #sidelinks a:hover { color:#3fada8; background:#fff; text-decoration:none; } #data-center { float:right; height:auto; width:400px; background:#fafafa; text-align:center; border-1px solid #aaa; border-radius:4px; margin:5px 20px; } #data-center .half { width:160px; height:300px; height:auto!important; display:inline-block; margin:0!important; } @media screen and (max-width:750px) { #sidelinks { width:100%; float:none; display:block; margin:auto; } #sidelinks a { width:96%; text-align:center; } #sidelinks p { display:block; margin:auto; text-align:center; } #data-center { width:100%; float:none; display:block; margin: auto; width:95%; } }\n\n/*--><!]]>*/\n</style><div id=\"sidelinks\">\n<p><a href=\"http://it.iiitd.edu.in/\">Visit IT Portal</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://it.iiitd.edu.in/HowCanI.pdf\">How can I</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://erp.iiitd.edu.in/login.action\">ERP</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>IIIT-D has state of art IT tools for communication &amp; computation needs within the institute, supported by fast, reliable &amp; rugged 500+ node computer network.

A tenure-track faculty is expected to engage heavily in research and teaching. The eligibility criteria for tenure-track faculty positions are similar as in IITs.\u00a0 <strong><em>For an Assistant Professor position, a candidate must have a PhD</em></strong>\u00a0 plus three years experience. However, for PhDs from a well known University/Institute (e.g. IITs/IISc/TIFR/ISI/... in India or well known research universities across the world), and a good research/academic record, the 3 years experience requirement may be waived.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The pay scale for faculty is same as in IITs. In addition, extra\u00a0personal pay may be provided. All regular faculty will be provided on-campus or leased accommodation. Other benefits include initiation research grant, travel support, professional development fund, etc., and personal benefits such as health insurance, LTC, contribution to pension plan, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">IIIT-Delhi follows a tenure model in which an initial contract is given for 5/7 years. Before completion of initial contract, an extensive evaluation of performance of Research &amp; Teaching is done. If the faculty member\u2019s performance is good, he/she can expect to get promoted and tenured.\u00a0</p>\n<!--Some insights on <a href=\"https://jalote.wordpress.com/2015/06/14/assessing-a-faculty-candidate/\">how assessment for faculty positions is done is discussed in this blog article</a> of the Director. --><p class=\"rtejustify\">The overall selection process is given below. Please visit the Institute website for more information, in particular the <a href=\"https://www.iiitd.ac.in/people/faculty\">faculty page to get a sense of the faculty profile</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">IIIT-Delhi cherishes and encourages gender diversity, and urges women candidates to apply for faculty positions. We are proud to have about 17% female students in our undergraduate program, and over 46% in our PG programs - which we believe is the highest in India in Technical Institutions. About 11% of our faculty is also female - while not as high as the Institute desires, it is better than most technical institutions. Almost 37% of our admin officers are women.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Senior Level Positions.</strong> At senior levels, IIIT-Delhi hopes to attract a selected few who have well established global reputation in research and development and who can take leadership for new centers, programs, etc. Applications are particularly invited from senior researchers who are looking for a suitable opportunity to establish a center in India in some specialized area, particularly interdisciplinary areas.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Visiting\u00a0Positions and Sabbaticals.</strong>\u00a0IIIT-Delhi's faculty are engaged in over 30 collaborations with various academic institutions\u00a0and research labs across the world. The institute will like to host visitors on their Sabbatical or other programs, like the <a href=\"http://dst.gov.in/vajra\">Vajra scheme</a>. If you are interested in establishing some collaboration, please contact the faculty member you may want to work with or the Director. Senior people who are willing to spend 2 or more years and take up some leadership / administrative position are also invited to contact.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Teaching-Track Positions.\u00a0</strong>To promote excellence in teaching, IIIT-Delhi has created a few teaching-track faculty positions, which are primarily targeted towards attracting outstanding teachers into the Institute, and to whom both students and faculty may look up as role-models for teaching. Teaching-track faculty members are regular faculty members in the Institute but with a different emphasis between teaching and research. They will have a higher teaching load and will be expected to engage in high quality teaching, and accordingly, will be expected to have a modest level of engagement in research. The criterion for tenure and promotion also has a higher expectation in quality teaching than research. Minimum qualifications for a teaching-track Assistant Professor is same as mentioned above. However suitable candidates with MTech/MS/ Equivalent\u00a0and at least 5 years experience are also eligible, if their teaching record and reputation is outstanding.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>A candidate can apply anytime as faculty applications are processed regularly.

Same relaxation also applies to candidates who are <em>physically handicapped</em> (category PH) or children/war widow of defense personnel killed/disabled in action (category CW). For candidates falling in multiple reservation categories, a maximum of 5% relaxation as specified above will be given.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Is there a part time PhD program?</strong><br/>\n\tIIIT-D PhD program is a full time program; part-time option is currently not available.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Is there any option to do a part-time sponsored PhD?</strong><br/>\n\tNo.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>How is full-time sponsored PhD different from part-time PhD?</strong><br/>\n\tIIIT-Delhi does not have part-time PhD program - both for regular as well as sponsored candidates. Full-time sponsored PhD candidates have same load as that of regular PhD candidates. They are expected to work full-time on their research problem. However, they may be permitted to work up to 10-12 hours a week in teaching/R&amp;D related activities of their sponsoring organization with permission from the Institute.<br/>\n\tFor example, full-time regular PhD students spend 10-15 hours a week on Research/Teaching Assistant duties. Similarly, afull time sponsored PhD student from a company may be allowed to do some other work (which is somewhat aligned to his PhD) for about 10 to 12 hours a week in the sponsoring company, and, a full-time sponsored PhD student from a collegemay be allowed to do about 10-12 hours of teaching work (including all preparation, examination, grading time) in the sponsoring college.<br/>\n\tThis is different from a part-time PhD program, where a candidate works only part-time on the research problem.</li>\n<li><strong>What do I need to do other than filling up the online form? Do I need to post a print out of the application form? Do I need to post copy of my certificates, mark sheets, etc.?</strong><br/>\n\tYou do not need to send us print out of your application form, copies of your mark sheets, certificates or anything else. Filing up an online form is enough.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>How many seats are there for PhD admission this year?</strong><br/>\n\tThere is no fixed number of seats for PhD program in any year. The number of candidates admitted will depend primarily on the quality of applications.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Will I be selected for the written test/interview if I meet the eligibility criteria?</strong><br/>\n\tNo, not necessarily. You can apply only if you meet the eligibility criteria. However, after you apply, the admission committee verifies your application, and performs a screening (usually done by a committee of faculty members). You will be selected for the next step (written or interview, as appropriate) only if you clear the screening.<br/>\n\tScreening is done considering each application in totality, and is a subjective decision made on the basis of marks, education, qualifications, awards, projects, work experiences, research experiences, and other relevant information present in the application.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I am in my final semester of BTech/BE/MTech/ME. Am I eligible to apply?</strong><br/>\n\tCandidates in the final year of their programs and who expect to complete all their qualifying degree requirements before the date of registration are also eligible to apply for admissions. For shortlisting and selection purposes, their performance until the preceding semester (preceding year if their programs are year based) would be considered but their admission would be provisional, subject to their meeting the minimum eligibility criteria after their final qualifying examination results are announced.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>What are the coursework requirements for the PhD program?</strong><br/>\n\tRefer to the <a href=\"/sites/default/files/docs/education/2017/2017-July-PG-Regulations.pdf\">PG regulations</a>.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>What is the duration of the program?

Can I change my research area later?</strong><br/>\n\tYou should choose a research area based on your research interest. Please go through the list of research groups and faculty members.

Our motto is that our ambitions should drive us to dream big and gender bias should not be a hurdle. Curiosity inspires us, and our determination fuels us to accomplish our goals, letting no obstacle stand in our way. These are the traits that make women stronger, and they give us the unique ability to create positive change in communities, organizations, and businesses that span the globe. At IIIT-Delhi we ensure that women are half of the work force of the country, and we would go to any extent to empower that better half od our strength. The WI connect is an inclusive on-campus student center which strives to create change on campus in response to sexism and misogyny, doing social justice work at the intersection of many identities such as sex, gender identity, gender expression, race, class, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and ability.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">We are a community of diversely feminist, social-justice-oriented individuals. We work to enrich our communities through social gatherings,  informative session on women rights, and social justice. we are working towards diversifying framework and by nurturing holistic individual growth through activism, events, post-classroom learning, and consciousness-raising engagement.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Over the years we have noticed that women account for half of the students in law, medical, and business programs, however, women in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields are still way underrepresented, and women receive less financial aid than their male classmates. So, while gains have been made for women in academia there are still innumerable disparities, explicit and implicit, on the campus college and later in the workforce. We strive to make their campuses safe, inclusive, and supportive of women, and actualizing liberation in all aspects of the Center\u2019s work, striving for greater equity, retention, advancement, and empowerment of women-identified students, staff, and faculty.</p>\n<h3><strong>Academic Life</strong></h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">At IIIT-Delhi the disparity between men and women on campus is far lower than the national average of other technical institutions.

Students who are on assistantship (and are earning the remuneration portion) shall be given a relaxation of upto 4 units in the normal full time load. A student may be permitted an overload of at most 4 units in a semester, with permission from the PG committee. The students who have completed the stipulated course requirements shall register for the thesis units in multiple of 4 units (i.e. 4, 8, 12 or 16). No overload shall be permitted in the thesis unit registration. Part time students may register for any number of units lesser than the normal full-time load.</p>\n<h3 class=\"rtejustify\"><strong><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\">Course Work Requirements</span></strong></h3>\n<ol><li class=\"rtejustify\">The requirement of the course work for a PhD student is aimed at providing the basic academic preparation to carry out the research, and have sufficient breadth in the area. The minimum course requirement for a PhD student is normally 32 units for students whose highest degree is a BTech (or equivalent), and 16 for those who have an MTech (or equivalent). The PG committee may ask the students with insufficient background to do additional courses (in addition to 32/16 units). For detailed course of requirement refer <a href=\"https://iiitd.ac.in/sites/default/files/docs/education/2015-July-PG-Regulations.pdf\">PG regulations</a></li>\n<li class=\"rtejustify\">In special cases, for students with advance standing by virtue of their academic preparedness and/or by virtue of their professional work experience, some of the course requirements may be waived. All such waivers shall be decided upon by the PG Committee and reported to the Senate.</li>\n<li class=\"rtejustify\">The PhD students are expected to finish their course requirements as per the timelines mentioned in <a href=\"https://iiitd.ac.in/sites/default/files/docs/education/2015-July-PG-Regulations.pdf\">PG Regulations.</a></li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify; padding-bottom:10px;\">Transfer of Credits for Courses done Outside: Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute outside IIIT-Delhi. Based on their performance/quantum of work done and the content of the course, the PG committee may consider them equivalent to some course credits, and waive credit requirements for similar courses/projects within IIIT-Delhi. Institutions with which IIIT-Delhi has arrangements/MOU/student exchange programs, transfer of credits may also be permitted. Any such waivers/transfer is permitted only if the courses being considered have not been counted for any other degree/diploma requirement.</li>\n<li class=\"rtejustify\">A PhD student may be permitted to replace up to two courses done by him/her and in which he/she has obtained passing, but not good, grade. The replacement will be permitted as and when the request is made by the concerned student. In this case, the earlier course will be listed in the transcript as having been taken on \u201cAudit\u201d. He / She may also be permitted to do extra courses to improve the CGPA. All such permissions shall be granted by the PG committee upon requests from the students.</li>\n</ol><h3 class=\"rtejustify\"><strong><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\">Teaching Requirements</span></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">One of the potential career options for the research students is academics. The PhD program at IIIT-Delhi aims to develop suitable teaching skills among the research students through teaching requirements. Towards this, it requires all students on financial assistantship plan of the Institute are required to take part in the teaching activities. All PhD students must be TA for at least two semesters to satisfy the teaching requirements for a PhD degree. Students on research assistantship will also be required to complete this requirement, though they may be assigned lighter load each semester. The teaching requirement may be waived for part-time and/or sponsored candidates.</p>\n<h3 class=\"rtejustify\"><strong><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\">Thesis Requirements</span></strong></h3>\n<ol><li class=\"rtejustify\">All PhD students irrespective of their entry category are expected to successfully complete a minimum of 56 units by thesis. In truly exceptional cases where the PhD candidate is ready with a thesis before he/she has accumulated these credits, the PG committee can consider waiving off some of these units. For the purpose of grading in the thesis units registered, the progress in the thesis work shall be assessed by the thesis supervisor(s). For each semester, one S (if the performance is satisfactory) or one X (if the performance is not satisfactory) grade shall be awarded by the thesis supervisor(s). The thesis grades shall be submitted by the thesis supervisor(s) at the end of the semester.</li>\n<li class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Thesis supervisor and external co-supervisor: </strong>The thesis work shall be done under the guidance of the PhD supervisor, who shall be a faculty member of the Institute. There may be multiple supervisors. Normally, a student is expected to decide the supervisor(s) by the start of the second semester but can defer it till the end of second semester .This will be done by informing the PG Committee through a form, which shall be signed by the supervisor(s). A student can change the supervisor later \u2013 for this a formal request will have to be submitted to PG Committee and has to be signed by the old as well as the new supervisor. A student may also have external co-supervisors for the thesis. Such external co-supervisor shall be approved by the PG Committee upon a request by the student, duly approved and forwarded by the supervisor(s). The request must be accompanied by the CV/Bio or sufficient information about the proposed external co-supervisor which will allow the PGC to evaluate the suitability. Normally, the external co-supervisor should be finalized before the comprehensive and the PGC should be informed by the adviser and the student about the same.</li>\n<li class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Thesis evaluation and defense:</strong> All PhD theses will be evaluated by a panel of thesis examiners who are experts in that area, and the candidate will have to defend the thesis in front of this panel. The panel will consist of supervisor(s) of the student, and a minimum of three non-supervisor examiners, at most one of which can be from within the Institute. A thesis defense date will be fixed, after taking inputs from all examiners on the panel. The defense shall be open to all. At the end of the defense, the panel will deliberate and make an overall recommendation.</li>\n</ol></div></div></div> </div>\n<footer>\n</footer>\n</div>\n</div> <!-- /.block -->\n</div>\n<!-- /.region -->\n<!-- /.region -->\n<!-- line added by ankit -->\n</div>", "Payment Schedule for AY 2018-19": "<div id=\"content-wrap\">\n<!-- line added by ankit -->\n<h1 class=\"page-title\">Payment Schedule for AY 2018-19</h1> <div class=\"region region-help\">\n<div class=\"block block-system\" id=\"block-system-main\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"Payment Schedule for AY 2018-19\" property=\"dc:title\"></span><span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" property=\"sioc:num_replies\"></span>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><style>\ntable { width:75% !important;}\ntr, td { text-align:center; }\na { color:#000;}\n</style><!--<div style=\"float:left; width:400px; font-weight:bold;\"><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/admission/fees/loan-scheme\">SBI Education Loan Scheme</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/admission/fees/loan-scheme\">PNB Pratibha Education Loan Scheme</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>--></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>", "Frequently Asked Questions on MTech Admissions (2016)": "<div id=\"content-wrap\">\n<!-- line added by ankit -->\n<h1 class=\"page-title\">Frequently Asked Questions on MTech Admissions (2016)</h1> <div class=\"region region-help\">\n<div class=\"block block-system\" id=\"block-system-main\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"Frequently Asked Questions on MTech Admissions (2016)\" property=\"dc:title\"></span><span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" property=\"sioc:num_replies\"></span>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><strong>Is M.Tech(CB) a specialisation under M.Tech(CSE)?</strong></p>\n<p>No, M.Tech, computation biology, often known as M.Tech(CB) is a different programme.

Any such change if done without information will be considered invalid and in that case student will lose his/her BTP credits.</li>\n<li>In a BTP, at most 2 students can be allowed to register together. In that case the students have to clearly state the distribution of the work. \u00a0The work of the two students will be evaluated individually but the thesis does not necessarily have to be different. However, if a faculty would like to engage more than 2 students on a project, then the faculty would be required to divide the project into independent modules and advertise each module as a separate BTP.</li>\n<li>In case a student is incapable of completing the BTP, he will be able to withdraw his BTP by last date of \u2018Late Drop\u2019 and will be given a Withdrawal (W) Grade. In case, a BTP is withdrawn after the last date of Late Drop, the student shall be given a Fail (F) grade.</li>\n<li>If a student withdraws his/her BTP before the completion of a minimum requirement of 8 credits spanned over at least 2 long semesters, then the credits earned by the student in the previous semester/s would not count towards 156 credits of graduation requirements.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Presentation / Evaluation:</strong></h3>\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\n<li>Each semester the student has to register for a BTP course with the respective number of credits and with the supervisor /a co-supervisor as the course instructor. For registration for BTP, the student need to register on ERP and the advisor should approve the same on ERP.</li>\n<li>The BTP advisors are required to constitute the BTP evaluation committee with the consent of the faculty members in the beginning of the semester.</li>\n<li>At the end of the semester, the BTP thesis/report must be submitted. The BTP will be evaluated by a committee of (three) faculty members (one or two advisors) and two committee members who will assign the final grade.</li>\n<li>At the end of the semester, the student has to present his BTP in the poster format and submit the BTP report to the advisor and evaluation committee members.</li>\n<li>The student(s) can also request for an extension in the submission of final report, in case he feels that some more work is to be done.\u00a0 However, the BTP committee and BTP advisor(s) will recommend BTP extension only if the student has already done good work in BTP and he/she wishes to further improve the quality of the work or to submit the work for publication.</li>\n<li>The student seeking BTP extension will be required to submit an interim report to the BTP advisor and the BTP evaluation committee. The BTP evaluation committee may also compare the interim report with the final BTP report, which will be submitted by the student at the time of BTP evaluation.</li>\n<li>Despite the BTP extension, students will have to present their work during the poster presentation session scheduled at the end of the semester.</li>\n<li>For presentation, a single BTP may be given a maximum of half an hour and a joint BTP may be given a maximum of one hour. In case of a joint BTP, both the students will be required to present their BTP work.</li>\n<li>In case of the 2nd or 3rd semester of the BTP, student(s) should give a quick review of the work done in the previous semester(s) in the beginning of the presentation.</li>\n<li>The\u00a0<strong>final BTP report</strong>\u00a0has to be written using the specified LaTeX template(s).</li>\n<li>The title page of the BTP report needs to be updated and should clearly mention the BTP category.</li>\n<li>The structure of the\u00a0<strong>final BTP report</strong>\u00a0should be as specified below (any deviation from this structure requires the approval of the UGC chair which needs to be obtained before the late course drop date in the respective semester).</li>\n<li>It is recommended that the interim BTP reports also use the same template and try to follow the same structure (items which are not yet done may be omitted).</li>\n<li><strong>Report for a Research project:</strong><br/>\n\tThe report may be in a paper format or a technical report format (both using the LaTeX template) and must contain at least:</li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>", "Instructions For B.Tech Foreign Admission Applications AY 2019-2020": "<div id=\"content-wrap\">\n<!-- line added by ankit -->\n<h1 class=\"page-title\">Instructions For B.Tech Foreign Admission Applications AY 2019-2020</h1> <div class=\"region region-help\">\n<div class=\"block block-system\" id=\"block-system-main\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"Instructions For B.Tech Foreign Admission Applications AY 2019-2020\" property=\"dc:title\"></span><span class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" property=\"sioc:num_replies\"></span>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><ol>\n<li>After reading the instructions, click on the 'Allow me to apply online' button at the bottom of this page.
